            Ai art is still controversial and some art creators may suffer from some external accusations that their works are AI generated and not human paintings. Therefore, it is important for us to maintain our own thinking and analysis in the face of controversy. Here are some tips for you to consider.</div>

            <h1>(1) Watch the video of the artist's drawing process</h1><br>
                Nowadays, AI can not only "draw" it can also fake the drawing process, but faking the drawing process in the form of video is difficult to imitate with current technology, so the drawing process in the form of video is more credible than the drawing process in the form of pictures.
                This is an intuitive and fast way to know if it is an ai painting, but not all artists upload their paintings on the internet, so we can use the way to help us think about and distinguish between ai paintings and human paintings.

            <h1>(2) Understanding the logic behind the drawing steps </h1> <br>
                We need to understand the purpose and logic of the painting steps
                Although each artist will have their own painting habits and the order in which they do the steps will change, the meaning behind each step is the same. This is because every step in a painting serves the purpose of the picture.

            <h2>Steps in painting:</h2><br>
            <b style="color: red">Drafting:</b><br>The whole picture will be very messy and free, the artist builds what they want to draw by drawing sketches vaguely, like the foundation of a house.<br><br>
            <b style="color: red">Outlining:</b><br>Simplify the sketch, make the content of the picture clear, clarify the content of the picture like the bricks of a house.<br><br>
            <b style="color: red">Coloring:</b><br>Filling the lines with the original color of the object (basic color). This is to determine the original appearance of the object without the influence of any lighting or environment. Like painting a house.<br><br>
            <b style="color: red">Lighting and Shadow:</b><br> determining the ambient colors for the objects in the picture.<br><br>
            <b style="color: red">Refinement:</b><br> to express the materials and shapes of the objects.<br><br>
            <b style="color: red">Post-Production:</b><br> To adjust the colors of the image to achieve the effect desired by the artist.<br><br>

            Zoom in and observe to look for detail errors, such as looking directly at expressions, hands, eyes, other structures of the human body, other common-sense errors, etc., which are also often easy for AI to make. Identify ai drawings and human drawings by looking at the details.<br><br><br>
            <b style="color: red">SOME UNREASONABLE PLACES</b><br><br>
            The place that does not conform to human common sense: Ai painting common error in human body parts, you can observe whether it conforms to the normal human body structure, or some objects do not conform to the normal logic of the place, it may be AI generated.<br><br><br>

            <b style="color: red">ELEMENTS THAT DON"T FIT IN WITH THE PAINTING</b><br><br>
            The AI painting may show something unrelated to the subject, resulting in a scene that doesn't fit the style of the character.<br><br><br>
            <b style="color: red">INEFFECTIVE REFINEMENT MAKES THE PICTURE FEEL OILY</b><br><br>
            <h5 style="text-align: center">"It's like having oil on your hands, it's too smooth."</h5><br>
            AI painting can draw a lot of details on the painting, but it lacks the unique personality and creativity of human painters.Human painters are conscious of the primary and secondary relationships to the picture. Humans are "lazier" than ai. And ai paintings will only add a lot of details to create a seemingly "beautiful" picture, but when zoomed in to see the details of ai painting will be very dull. If the details of the painting is overdrawn, it leads to a lack of originality and vividness.
